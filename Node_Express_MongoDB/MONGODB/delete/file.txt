DEFINATION:
Delete operations remove documents from a collection. MongoDB provides methods to delete single or multiple documents based on specified criteria.

1> db.collection.deleteOne(filter): This method deletes the first document that matches the provided filter criteria.
ex,
db.users.deleteOne({ name: "John Doe" });

2> db.collection.deleteMany(filter): This method deletes all documents that match the provided filter criteria.
ex,
 db.products.deleteMany({ category: "Electronics" });

 3> db.collection.deleteMany({}): When an empty filter {} is provided, this method deletes all documents within the collection.
